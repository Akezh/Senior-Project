You will be given an array of integers `a` consisting of `n` elements. You have to calculate the sum of elements in the array.

#### Constraints:

```
1 <= n <= 1e5
-1e5 <= a[i] <= 1e5
```

#### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 3, a = [1, 6, 7]
Output: 14
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 3, a = [5, 9, 3]
Output: 17
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: n = 2, a = [-2, -3]
Output: -5
```
